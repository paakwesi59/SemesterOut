#Barbering shop simulation   

#Description   
This is a java program that simulates the daily activities of a barbering salon. The salon has a main chair for trimming of hair and five other chairs for waiting.  This program uses an array and loops to implement the queue data structure for the waiting and seating arrangement.   
The salon serves two types of customers: VIP customers(VIP), Ordinary Customer(ORD).  
The program asks the user for an input, and generates a random event, and handles the event to determine the current state of the salon. The loop runs until a user enters a key other than space bar.

#Features   
**Customer Arrival**: The program simulates the arrival of both VIP and ORD customers.  
**Seating Management**: The program manages the seating of the customers in the main chair and the waiting chair using the queue data structure.  
**Event Handling**: The program handles events such as baber done with haircut and customer arrivals.  
**Console Output**: Displays the current state of the salon and the seating arrangement after each event.
